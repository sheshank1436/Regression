    "#### 1. What Are the Basic Assumption for applying the Linear Regression Model? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four assumptions associated with a linear regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.Homoskedastic (also spelled \"homoscedastic\") refers to a condition in which the variance of the residual, or error term, in a regression model is constant. That is, the error term does not vary much as the value of the predictor variable changes.\n",
    "- Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- Normality(skewness): For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed."
   ]

    "#### 2.Advantages\n",
    "- Linear regression performs exceptionally well for linearly separable data\n",
    "- Easy to implement and train the model\n",
    "- It can handle overfitting using dimensionlity reduction techniques and cross validation and regularization"

    "#### 3. Disadvantages\n",
    "- Sometimes Lot of Feature Engineering Is required\n",
    "- If the independent features are correlated it may affect performance\n",
    "- It is often quite prone to noise and overfitting"

    "#### 4. Whether Feature Scaling is required?\n",
    "- Yes\n",
    "- Because whenever we are talking or using optimizer, loss function there we need to scale the data\n",
    "- In ANN also we do feature scaling because we are using Gradient descent optimization\n",
    "- If we dont do feature scaling our gradients will be very much bigger\n",
    "- If we do feature scaling we can reach the global minima in a very short time"

    "- It is sensitive to missing values\n",

   "source": [
    "#### 6. Impact of outliers?\n",
    "- It is also important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.\n",
    "- Due to outliers the regression line slope changes which eventually leads to wrong predictions\n",
    "- linear regression needs the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear. "
